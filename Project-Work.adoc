== Chapter 1: INTRODUCTION
Robotic vehicles normally use RF for remote-controlling the movement from a distance. This has limited distance range and also interference problems with other close by RF transmitters.  In this project, a small robotic vehicle is built fitted with a mobile phone and acoustically coupled to a circuit that can detect the tones generated by the earphone of the mobile. 

==== MOBILE PHONES
An ordinary mobile phone is used as a remote control. A call is made to the mobile on the robot and picked up manually. Any key pressed on the mobile generates a complex frequency (touch tone), which is heard in the vehicular-mobile.

==== ROBOTIC VEHICLE
The vehicle is controlled with the hand-held mobile by pressing pre-assigned keys, which will be decoded by circuits in the robot and used to control its movements. The robot vehicle has tone decoder circuits and logic gates with relays and DC motors to control it.

==== SURVEILLANCE CAMERA
A mini wireless camera is placed in front of the vehicle, which transmits continuous video, which is received by a small TV kept near the remote mobile. This helps in navigating the mobile when it is not within visible range.

==== WORKING CONTROLS
Keys assigned for control are 1-start; 3- stop; 2-forward; 8-reverse; 4-left; 6-right 0 can be used for self-destruction when used in military warfare. The micro controller can be programmed for other tasks also.

==== WORKING MODEL
A working model will be demonstrated approximately 12” long and 6”high.

In today’s extremely fast-paced life, almost everyone looks for ‘easy living’ solutions, that is, ways and means to carry out their tasks with the minimal efforts. Every single modern device that has been invented, aims exactly at this. There has never been a dearth of people to work on Industrial projects, which is why I decided to focus on the components that would enable a user to control the movement of a robotic vehicle from any remote location.

The telephone is the most wide spread communication device in this world. There is a telephone in every house and cell phones are now rampant use in almost in every strata of our society. Therefore, it is fairly obvious that they would come into use in our daily life system. Millions of people around the world use **cellular phones**. They are such great gadgets - with a cell phone, you can talk to anyone on the planet from just about anywhere!

These days, cell phones provide an incredible array of functions, and new ones are being added at a breakneck pace. Depending on the cell-phone model, you can:<o:p></o:p>

Store contact information, Make task or to-do lists, Keep track of appointments and set reminders, Use the built-in calculator for simple math, Send or receive email, Get information (news, entertainment, stock quotes) from the Internet, Play simple games or even Integrate other devices such as http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/pda.htm[PDAs], http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/mp3-player.htm[MP3 players] and http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gps.htm[GPS receivers].

The usage of the cellular phone to control other electronic equipment is very unheard of, leave alone controlling a well equipped surveillance robotic vehicle. Hence I decided to undertake this possibility as my project to convert world wide communication tool into a wide range surveillance tool. In the following pages, I have attempted to give a clear idea of the various technology based on which my project has been undertaken.


== TOUCH-TONE DIALING – AN INTRODUCTION
Although most of us take it completely for granted, the telephone we have in our house is one of the most amazing devices ever created. If we want to talk to someone, all we have to do is pick up the phone and dial a few digits. We are instantly connected to that person, and we can have a two-way conversation. The telephone network extends worldwide, so we can reach nearly anyone on the planet. When we compare that to the state of the world just 100 years ago, when it might have taken several weeks to get a one-way written message to someone, we realize just how amazing the telephone is!<o:p></o:p>

When Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, it had an extremely simple construction. It consisted of an electromagnetic transmitter and electromagnetic receiver connected together with a battery, and produced sounds too feeble for general applications in a practical telephone system.

Further improvements were made by the development of duplex or hybrid circuits in which most of the electrical energy developed by the transmitter is directed to the distant station, with a minimum entering the speaker receiver. A small multi-winding audio transformer and balancing network, placed inside each telephone, provides the full duplex operation described over a two-wire circuit.

Earlier a rotary dialing system was used. Here, the signal is made up of opening and closing of the circuit, occurring at a rate of about 10 times per second during counter clockwise rotation of the dial. The number that is dialed, with the exception of zero, determines the circuit opens and closes during dialing. When a zero is dialed, the circuit opens and closes ten times.

There were many disadvantages of Dial Pulse System which led to the need of a better transmission method, Touch-tone dialing.

Some of the disadvantages are:

. It was not suited for long distance communication
. It had no reliability
. It was prone to Interference
. It could not be used over microwave systems

A marked improvement over the rotary telephone dial was accomplished through the use of ‘push-button dialing’. This method of dialing is also known as Touch-Tone dialing. This was made possible as a result of solid-state technology and the need for a more rapid and accurate means of dialing. This method also provides a means of communication between the customer’s telephone and other associated equipment, computers for example. The rotary dial was unable to provide this service since it could control only the telephone company local central office equipment.

The push button dial consists of a series of twelve push buttons, ten of them labeled one through zero and two additional buttons used for specialized functions. When any one button is pressed, a solid state circuit inside the telephone set produces a pair of precise audio tone which are in the voice frequency range, so that they can be transmitted whenever telephone communications are available. We can have separate tones for each digit, but there is a chance that a random noise or sound can be of the same frequency and this may trip the system. So it was reasoned out that if two tones were present to represent a number or digit, then a false signal is likely to occur. This is the basis for dual-tone in Touch-tone dialing. The frequencies are divided into two bands, low band and high band, and each button selects one frequency from each band.

These two frequencies, which are unique for each digit, form the base for Touch-tone dialing. When a digit key is pressed on the keypad a dual tone with two frequencies, high and low band are generated and transmitted to receiving towers. These tones when sent on a transmission line are free from interference and errors while transmitting data signals through transmission lines. Hence this principle is widely used in modern telephone equipments. DTMF (Dual Tone Multi Frequency) is the generic term for touch-tone. Touch-tone is the registered trademark of AT&T.

If two tones are present for each digit, then it eliminates the need for 24 tones for the twelve keys in the telephone (0-9,*, #). Earlier, tones were generated using coils and capacitors instead of IC’s that are employed today. So the idea of rows and columns were introduced.

=== A, B, C AND D TOUCH TONE KEYS

These are extensions to the standard touch-tones (0-9, *, #) which originated with the U.S. military's Autovon phone network. The original names of these keys were FO (Flash Override), F (Flash), I (Immediate), and P (Priority) which represented priority levels that could establish a phone connection with varying degrees of immediacy, killing other conversations on the network if necessary with FO being the greatest priority, down to P being of lesser priority. The tones are more commonly referred to as the A, B, C and D tones respectively, and all use a 1633 Hz as their high tone.


Nowadays, these keys/tones are mainly used in special applications such as amateur radio repeaters for their signaling or control. Modems   and touch tone circuits tend to include the A, B, C and D tones as well. These tones have not been used for general public service, and it would take years before these tones could be used in such things as customer information lines; such services would have to be compatible with the existing 12-button touch tone sets in any case.

==== DTMF IN TWO-WAY RADIOs
DTMF signals can be transmitted over the radio and turn things on/off, flash lights, control motors, cameras, warning systems excused over two-way radios by transmitting a DTMF phone number. The phone number is programmed in a decoder hooked up to a radio receiver at a remote location. When the decode sees the number coming in over the radio, it is activated and controls devices connected to it. Even wild cards can be used to confirm multiple locations with one DTMF signal. For example, let the DTMF codes be used for opening the overhead doors of a fire station. To remove all the overhead doors, information has to be sent for each door. This involves waste of time, instead a wild card can be used to open all the doors collectively.

===== ADVANTAGES OF DTMF TRANSMISSION
. The tones are not prone to interference during transmission.
. The tones are not affected by noise during transmission.
. Probability of error is less.
. These tones can be used for long distance communication

==== INTRODUCTION TO CMOS TECHNOLOGY
		
Digital Integrated circuits have been available for a good many years , and most are familiar with common logic family names such as TTL(transistor-transistor)logic and ECL(Emitter-coupled)logic, as well as those of older families such as RTL(resistor-transistor)logic and DTL(diode-transistor logic). Each of these families offers its own particular advantages when compared with other types, but all of them share a number of common disadvantages.

The most significant of these disadvantages are high quiescent current requirement (typically 5mA per gate, tight power supply requirements (supplies typically have to be regulated to within 10% of a specific value), low input impedance (typically a few hundred ohms per gate) and poor noise immunity (meaning that gates can be easily triggered by spikes on the input or supply lines.

In the early 1970’s a new and startlingly different type of digital IC appeared on the scene, and rapidly started to push all of the older families into obsolescence in low and medium speed applications. This new family of devices is known as COS/MOS or CMOS (Complementary-symmetry metal oxide semiconductor), and it suffers from none of the disadvantages of the earlier families.

Specifically, CMOS IC’s typically draw quiescent currents of a mere 0.01 µA per gate, can be operated from any supply within the range of 3-15 volts, have a typical input impedance of about a million mega ohms per gate (but are fully protected against static-charge damage via built-in safety circuitry), and have inherently excellent noise immunity that enable the IC’s to safely tolerate input spikes up to about 50% of the supply voltage without upset.

CMOS digital IC’s have excellent thermal characteristics, low-cost commercial types are designed to operate over the temperature range -40 0 C to -85 0 C, while the more expensive military versions can operate from -55 0 C to +125 0 C. CMOS digital IC’s are incredibly versatile devices.

==== CMOS TECHNOLOGY
The simplest type of circuit that can occur in any logical family is the inverter or NOT gate and this element forms the basics of virtually every other type of circuit element that is used in digital electronics.

image::images/Image-220716-103312.505.png[]


The operation of the circuit is quite simple. Inputs and outputs are always wither low (grounded or at logic-0) or high (at positive supply or logic-1). The RTL inverter has a fairly low impedance of about 500kand draws a quiescent current of either near-zero or 10mA. When driven by a low-frequency square wave, the circuit will draw a mean current of 5mA.

The basic circuit of a CMOS digital inverter or NOT gate comprises of nothing more than a P-channel and an N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET (Metal-Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor) wired in series between the two supply lines, with the MOSFET gates tied together at the input terminal and with the output taken from the junction of the two devices.

The input (gate) terminal of an enhancement-mode MOSFET presents near-infinite impedance to DC voltages, and the magnitude of an extremely applied gate-to-source voltage controls the magnitude of drain-to-source current flow. When these MOSFET’s are used in the digital mode (with either logic-0 or logic-1) they can be regarded as voltage controlled switches.

The basic digital action of the N-channel device is such that its drain-to-source path acts like an open-circuit switch when the input is at logic-0 or as a closed switch in series with a 400 resistor when the input is at logic-1. The P-channel MOSFET has the inverse of these characteristics, and acts like a closed switch plus a 400 resistance with a logic-0 input, and as an open switch with a logic-1 input.

The circuit thus draws quiescent current but can ’source’ fairly large drive currents into an external output-to-ground load via the 400 output resistance of the inverter.

 
. Most TTL and CMOS logic systems are designated to operate from a single supply voltage rail of nominally +5V. With TTL devices, it is important for this voltage to be very closely regulated. Typical TTL specifications call for regulation of better than ±5% (i.e., the supply voltage should not fall outside the range 4.75V to 5.25V)

. When operating at reduced supply voltage (particularly with CMOS devices) it is important to note the propagation delay (i.e., the time taken for a change of state to appear at the output in response to a change at the input) will be significantly increased. In order to maintain high switching speeds, it is important to use a relatively high value of supply voltage.

. The absolute maximum supply voltage for TTL devices is normally 7V. If the supply voltage ever exceeds this, any TTL device connected to the supply rail are liable to self destruct very quickly.

. CMOS logic offers greater tolerance of supply rail variations and operates from a wider range of supply voltages (typically 3V to 15V) than TTL. Coupled with minimal current demand, this makes CMOS an obvious choice of logic family for use battery operated (portable) equipment.

. TTL devices require considerably more supply current than their CMOS equivalents. A typical TTL logic gate requires a supply current of around 8mA, approximately 1000 times that of its CMOS counterpart, when operating at a typical switching speed of 10 kHz.

. CMOS devices consume negligible power in the quiescent state. Power consumption for a CMOS device is, however, proportional to switching speed and, when this is excess of several megahertz, power consumption may approach (or even exceed) that of a comparable TTL device.

. When operating from supply voltages in excess of 5V or so, these are more immune to noise than their TTL counterparts. This makes CMOS the obvious choice for any application in which noise is to be a problem.

. All CMOS devices are now fitted with input static protection diodes but these should not be relied upon for protection and appropriate static precautions should be adopted when handling such devices.
⊗	Un-buffered CMOS devices exhibit smaller propagation delay but slightly lower noise margin than comparable buffered types.

. Unused TTL devices inputs should be pulled-up to logic 1 (Vcc) using 1k or 2.2 resistors. One resistor will provide a pull-up for up to 25 unused standard gate inputs. Unused CMOS inputs should be connected to drain or source voltages depending upon the logic function.

. Both CMOS and TTL logic require low-impedance supplies, which are adequately decoupled. Supply borne noise (due to transient spikes), can usually be eliminated by placing capacitors of 100nF and 10µF at strategic points distributed around a PCB layout. As a general rule, one disc or plate capacitor (of between 10nF and 100nF suitably rated) should be fitted for every two or four devices, whilst an electrolytic capacitor (of between 4.7µF and 47µF suitably rated) should be fitted for every eight to ten devices. Buffers (both inverting and non-inverting) and line-drivers will normally require additional (individual) coupling.



In our day-to-day life we come across many electronic devices and gadgets which are being controlled by remote controls. All these days from the advent of Radio frequency transmission we are still using the methods of remote-controlling which are primitive. Though the gadgets and devices have evolved through ages our controlling techniques has not fallen in the same pattern. Also the present day remote controls using RF face many drawbacks such as limited Controlling range, interference problems with other close by RF transmitters, Frequency tuning with other transmitters being difficult.

A new controlling technique is required which is cost effective and also which enables wide coverage. Communication technology is one of the fastest developing fields in modern electronics. Hence the possibility and the advantages of converting this widely developed technology into controlling equipment have many encouraging aspects. 

In today’s world security and surveillance has become a daily commodity. Hence the need for cost effective, easily controllable and less complex equipment is felt everywhere. A mechanical model driven by electronics (ROBOT) vehicle which is controlled by a device which has become a part of humans in the past decade, MOBILE PHONES has been the brain-child of this project. The purpose of the project is to achieve control of a robotic vehicle using Touch-tone dialing, thus using Mobile Phones as MOTION CONTROL DEVICES. The project concentrates on the utility of this application on the military and other surveillance needs. This controlling technique developed succeeds in efficiently wiping out the weakness in RF and other types of transmission and controlling techniques.

Its uniqueness lies in its simplicity of design and principle of operation. This circuitry employs rudimentary, low cost digital Integrated Circuits. Installation of this system is easy and it can be operated by anyone with no need for prior extensive knowledge. Its novelty lies in the fact that it is very cost effective though its utility exceeds the equipment of higher costs.

=== Chapter 3: THE **CELL** APPROACH
One of the most interesting things about a cell phone is that it is actually a radio -- an extremely sophisticated radio. The telephone was invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876, and wireless communication can trace its roots to the invention of the radio by Nikolai Tesla in the 1880s (presented in 1894 by an Italian, named Guillermo Marconi). 

In the dark ages before cell phones, people who really needed mobile-communications ability installed radio telephones in their cars. In the radio-telephone system, there was one central antenna tower per city, and perhaps 25 channels available on that tower. This central antenna meant that the phone in a car needed a powerful transmitter -- big enough to transmit 40 or 50 miles (about 70 km). 

The genius of the cellular system is the division of a city into small cells. This allows extensive frequency reuse across a city, so that millions of people can use cell phones simultaneously. In a typical analog cell-phone, the cell-phone carrier receives about 800 frequencies to use across the city. The carrier chops the city into cells. Each cell is typically sized at about 10 square miles (26 square kilometers). Cells are normally thought of as a hexagon on a big hexagonal grid. Because cell phones and base stations use low-power transmitters, the same frequencies can be reused in non-adjacent cells.

Each cell has a base station that consists of a tower and a small building containing the radio equipment. A single cell in an analog system uses one-seventh of the available duplex voice channels. That is, each cell (of the seven on a hexagonal grid) is using one-seventh of the available channels so it has a unique set of frequencies and there are no collisions.

. A cell-phone carrier typically gets 832 radio frequencies to use in a city. 
. Each cell phone uses two frequencies per call -- a duplex channel -- so there are typically 395 voice channels per carrier. (The other 42 frequencies are used for control channels).
. Therefore, each cell has about 56 voice channels available. 
i.e., in any cell, 56 people can be talking on their cell phone at one time. With digital transmission methods, the number of available channels increases. 
  
Cell phones have low-power transmitters in them. Many cell phones have two signal strengths: 0.6 watts and 3 watts (for comparison, most CB radios transmit at 4 watts). The base station is also transmitting at low power. Low-power transmitters have two advantages:

. The transmissions of a base station and the phones within its cell do not make it very far outside that cell. Therefore both the cells can reuse the same 56 frequencies. The same frequencies can be reused extensively across the city. 
. The power consumption of the cell phone, which is normally battery-operated, is relatively low. Low power means small batteries, and this is what has made handheld cellular phones possible. 

The cellular approach requires a large number of base stations in a city of any size. A typical large city can have hundreds of towers. But because so many people are using cell phones, costs remain low per user. Each carrier in each city also runs one central office called the Mobile Telephone Switching Office (MTSO). This office handles all of the phone connections to the normal land-based phone system, and controls all of the base stations in the region.

CELL PHONE CODES
All cell phones have special codes associated with them. These codes are used to identify the phone, the phone's owner and the service provider
The following is the procedure that occurs when a call is placed to a mobile phone:

. When the phone is first is powered up, it listens for an SID on the control channel. The control channel is a special frequency that the phone and base station use to talk to one another about things like call set-up and channel changing. If the phone cannot find any control channels to listen to, it knows it is out of range and displays a "no service" message. 
. When it receives the SID, the phone compares it to the SID programmed into the phone. If the SIDs match, the phone knows that the cell it is communicating with is part of its home system. 
. Along with the SID, the phone also transmits a registration request, and the MTSO keeps track of your phone's location in a database -- this way, the MTSO knows which cell you are in when it wants to ring your phone. 
. The MTSO gets the call, and it tries to the mobile phone. It looks in its database to see which cell you are in. 
. The MTSO picks a frequency pair for the phone to take the call in that cell.
. The MTSO communicates with the mobile phone over the control channel to tell which frequencies to use, and once the mobile phone and the tower switch on those frequencies, the call is connected. 
. As the mobile phone moves toward the edge of the cell, the cell's base station notes that signal strength is diminishing. Meanwhile, the base station in the cell the mobile phone is moving towards (which is listening and measuring signal strength on all frequencies, not just its own one-seventh) sees the mobile phone's signal strength increasing. The two base stations coordinate with each other through the MTSO, and at some point, the phone gets a signal on a control channel telling it to change frequencies. This hand-off switches the mobile phone to the new cell. 


==== ROAMING
If the SID on the control channel does not match the SID programmed into your phone, then the phone knows it is roaming. The MTSO of the cell, in which the mobile is roaming, in turn contacts the MTSO of the home system, which then checks its database to confirm that the SID of the phone is valid. The home system verifies the phone to the local MTSO, which then tracks the phone as it move through its cells.

====  CELL PHONES AND CBS
The sophistication of a cell phone can be understood by comparing it to a CB radio or a walkie-talkie. 

. FULL-DUPLEX VS. HALF-DUPLEX - Both walkie-talkies and CB radios are half-duplex devices. That is, two people communicating on a CB radio use the same frequency, so only one person can talk at a time. A cell phone is a full-duplex device. That means that the mobile phone uses one frequency for talking and a second, separate frequency for listening. Both people on the call can talk at once. 
. CHANNELS - A walkie-talkie typically has one channel, and a CB radio has 40 channels. A typical cell phone can communicate on 1,664 channels.
. RANGE - A walkie-talkie can transmit about 1 mile (1.6 km) using a 0.25-watt transmitter. A CB radio, because it has much higher power, can transmit about 5 miles (8 km) using a 5-watt transmitter. Cell phones operate within cells, and they can switch cells as they move around. Cells give cell phones incredible range. Someone using a cell phone can drive hundreds of miles and maintain a conversation the entire time because of the cellular approach. 

==== INSIDE A CELL PHONE
On a **complexity per cubic inch** scale, cell phones are some of the most intricate devices people play with on a daily basis. Modern digital cell phones can process millions of calculations per second in order to compress and decompress the voice stream.
It contains the following individual parts:

. An amazing circuit board containing the brains of the phone 
. An antenna 
. A liquid crystal display (LCD) 
. A keyboard (not unlike the one you find in a TV remote control) 
. A microphone, a speaker and a battery

==== ON THE CIRCUIT BOARD
The circuit board is the heart of the system. Here is a typical Nokia digital phone: 

====== FRONT SIDE VIEW

====== BACK SIDE VIEW
image::images/Image-220716-104922.945.png[]

The analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion chips translate the outgoing audio signal from analog to digital and the incoming signal from digital back to analog. The digital signal processor (DSP) is a highly customized processor designed to perform signal-manipulation calculations at high speed.

===== THE MICROPROCESSOR 
The Microprocessor handles the keyboard and display, deals with command and control signaling with the base station and also coordinates the rest of the functions on the board. The ROM and Flash memory chips provide storage for the phone's operating system and customizable features, such as the phone directory. The radio frequency (RF) and power section handles power management and recharging, and also deals with the hundreds of FM channels. Finally, the RF amplifiers handle signals traveling to and from the antenna.

image::images/Image-220716-105032.784.png[]

====== FLASH MEMORY CHIPS
Some phones store certain information, such as the SID and MIN codes, in internal Flash memory, while others use external cards that are similar to Smart Media cards.

image::images/Image-220716-105325.532.png[]

===== ALONG COMES DIGITAL
Digital cell phones use the same radio technology as analog phones, but they use it in a different way. Analog systems do not fully utilize the signal between the phone and the cellular network -- analog signals cannot be compressed and manipulated as easily as a true digital signal. Digital phones convert your voice into binary information (1s and 0s) and then compress it. This compression allows between three and 10 digital cell-phone calls to occupy the space of a single analog call. 

Many digital cellular systems rely on frequency-shift keying (FSK) to send data back and forth over AMPS. FSK uses two frequencies, one for 1s and the other for 0s, alternating rapidly between the two to send digital information between the cell tower and the phone. Clever modulation and encoding schemes are required to convert the analog information to digital, compress it and convert it back again while maintaining an acceptable level of voice quality.

===== CELLULAR ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES
These are the common technologies used by cell-phones for transmitting information: 

. Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) 
. Time division multiple access (TDMA) 
. Code division multiple access (CDMA) 

The first word tells you what the access method is. The second word, division, lets you know that it splits calls based on that access method and multiple access means multi-user for each cell.

. FDMA puts each call on a separate frequency. 
. TDMA assigns each call a certain portion of time on a designated frequency. 
. CDMA gives a unique code to each call and spreads it over the available frequencies. 

====== CELLULAR ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES: FDMA
FDMA separates the spectrum into distinct voice channels by splitting it into uniform chunks of bandwidth. Each station sends its signal at a different frequency within the available band. FDMA is used mainly for analog transmission.

image::images/Image-220716-105439.531.png[]

===== CELLULAR ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES: TDMA
TDMA is the access method used by the Electronics Industry Alliance and the Telecommunications Industry Association for Interim Standard 54 (IS-54) and Interim Standard 136 (IS-136). Using TDMA, a narrow band that is 30 kHz wide and 6.7 milliseconds long is split time-wise into three time slots. 

Narrow band means **channels** in the traditional sense. Each conversation gets the radio for one-third of the time. This is possible because voice data that has been converted to digital information is compressed so that it takes up significantly less transmission space. Therefore, TDMA has three times the capacity of an analog system using the same number of channels. TDMA systems operate in either the 800-MHz (IS-54) or 1900-MHz (IS-136) frequency bands.

**TDMA SPLITS A FREQUENCY INTO TIME SLOTS**

image::images/Image-220716-105538.754.png[]

==== CELLULAR ACCESS TECHNOLOGIES: CDMA
CDMA takes an entirely different approach from TDMA. CDMA, after digitizing data, spreads it out over the entire available bandwidth. Multiple calls are overlaid on each other on the channel, with each assigned a unique sequence code. CDMA is a form of spread spectrum, which simply means that data is sent in small pieces over a number of the discrete frequencies available for use at any time in the specified range.

**IN CDMA, EACH PHONE'S DATA HAS A UNIQUE CODE**

image::images/Image-220716-105636.029.png[]

All of the users transmit in the same wide-band chunk of spectrum. Each user's signal is spread over the entire bandwidth by a unique spreading code. At the receiver, that same unique code is used to recover the signal. Because CDMA systems need to put an accurate time-stamp on each piece of a signal, it references the GPS system for this information. Between eight and 10 separate calls can be carried in the same channel space as one analog AMPS call. CDMA technology is the basis for Interim Standard 95 (IS-95) and operates in both the 800-MHz and 1900-MHz frequency bands.

Sound is an amazing thing. All of the different sounds that we hear are caused by minute pressure differences in the air around us. The amazing fact about it is that the air transmits those pressure changes so well, and so accurately, over relatively long distances. 

The first microphone was a metal diaphragm attached to a needle, and this needle scratched a pattern onto a piece of metal foil. The pressure differences in the air that occurred when you spoke toward the diaphragm moved the diaphragm, which moved the needle, which was recorded on the foil. When you later ran the needle back over the foil, the vibrations scratched on the foil would then move the diaphragm and recreate the sound.

All modern microphones are trying to accomplish the same thing as the original, but do it electronically rather than mechanically. A microphone wants to take varying pressure waves in the air and convert them into varying electrical signals. There are five different technologies commonly used to accomplish this conversion:

. **CARBON MICROPHONES** - The oldest and simplest microphone uses carbon dust. This is the technology used in the first telephones and is still used in some telephones today. The carbon dust has a thin metal or plastic diaphragm on one side. As sound waves hit the diaphragm, they compress the carbon dust, which changes its resistance. By running a current through the carbon, the changing resistance changes the amount of current that flows. 
. **DYNAMIC MICROPHONES** - A dynamic microphone takes advantage of electromagnet effects. When a magnet moves past a wire (or coil of wire), the magnet induces current to flow in the wire. In a dynamic microphone, the diaphragm moves either a magnet or a coil when sound waves hit the diaphragm, and the movement creates a small current. 
. **RIBBON MICROPHONES** - In a ribbon microphone, a thin ribbon is suspended in a magnetic field. Sound waves move the ribbon which changes the current flowing through it.
. **CONDENSER MICROPHONES** - A condenser microphone is essentially a capacitor, with one plate of the capacitor moving in response to sound waves. The movement changes the capacitance of the capacitor, and these changes are amplified to create a measurable signal. Condenser microphones usually need a small battery to provide a voltage across the capacitor.
. **CRYSTAL MICROPHONES** - Certain crystals change their electrical properties as they change shape. By attaching a diaphragm to a crystal, the crystal will create a signal when sound waves hit the diaphragm.

The one thing they all have in common is the diaphragm, which collects the sound waves and creates movement in whatever technology is being used to create the signal.

=== HOW MICROPHONES WORK

Microphones just convert a real sound wave into an electrical audio signal. In order to do so, they have a small, light material in them called the diaphragm. When the sound vibrations through the air reach the diaphragm, they cause the diaphragm to vibrate. This in turns will somehow cause an electrical current in the microphone to vary, whereupon it is sent out to a mixer, preamplifier or amplifier for use. Microphones are typically classified according to how the diaphragms produce sound. 

image::images/Image-220716-110135.740.png[]

==== DYNAMIC MICROPHONES
Dynamic microphones typically use moving-coil technology. This consists of a diaphragm of usually thin plastic being attached directly to a dense coil of wire. The coil has a magnet either surrounding it or at the centre. As the diaphragm vibrates, the coil vibrates, and its changing position relative to the magnet causes a varying current to flow through the coil. This current is your audio signal.

Dynamic microphones have hardy diaphragms, but are typically damaged when the suspension wires break, due to dropping or rough handling. These are the little things that hold the coil and diaphragm in a floating position relative to the magnets.

Dynamic microphones have to cause a whole coil of wires to move, a mountain when you're talking about little movements of air. This makes them not as sensitive as higher-grade microphones, especially to very soft sounds or high-pitched sounds, such as sibilants in speech or harmonics in music. They have a reputation of being very hardy, and some higher grade dynamic microphones can give a very clean and sensitive sound. Dynamic microphones are also known to give a **fat** sound, which is flattering to those frequencies that the human ear can hear. They are usually not expected to reproduce the sounds they pick up very faithfully.

==== CONDENSER MICROPHONES
The technology for condenser microphones has improved greatly in recent years, bringing costs down, increasing its hardiness, and making them even better. In condenser microphones, a static charge is impressed on the diaphragm or on a back-plate to the diaphragm. As the diaphragm vibrates, the distance from the back-plate to the diaphragm vibrates, altering the capacitance of the diaphragm and the back-plate. This fluctuating capacitance results in a fluctuating electric current.

Instead of moving a whole coil of wires, condenser microphones only have a thin diaphragm and solid back-plate making up a capacitor. Condenser microphones are therefore sometimes known as capacitor microphones.

==== CARBON GRANULE MICROPHONES
These are the microphones found in many older telephones. They consist of a heavy diaphragm placed within a 'bath' of minuscule carbon granules, sealed to prevent the granules from falling out. As in graphite cables, the carbon is used to conduct electricity. The vibration of the diaphragm alters the resistance of current passing through the microphone, creating an audio signal. Note that this type of microphone requires an electrical current to pass through its circuitry, while dynamic microphones create their own current. Condenser microphones sometimes have batteries within them, so they might be considered as being able to create their own current.

==== WIRELESS MICROPHONES
These microphones are essentially the same as ordinary microphones with a transmitter. The transmitter can be in the body of a handheld microphone (which accounts for the larger size of a wireless. Wireless microphones typically transmit on only one unique frequency per microphone. A 'true diversity' wireless system will have two antennae on the receiver end (which, incidentally, usually puts out a line-level signal for the mixer instead of a microphone signal). When the signal strength between the two antennae varies, the receiver will opt to receive the signal from the stronger antennae. This switching can be very rapid and is usually unnoticeable. True diversity wireless systems are usually far less sensitive to radio interference and blockage than single-antennae systems.

==== LAVALIERE MICROPHONES
The familiar 'interviewer's collar pin', which consists of a small, usually electrets microphone worn at the chest, clipped to clothing. This can either be corded or wireless, though the latter is usually preferred. The wireless version runs into a transmitter, usually worn on the belt. Lavaliere microphones can be powered by batteries or phantom power, depending on the make of the microphone. 

==== Amplification Basics  
The term **amplifier** has become generic, and is often thought to mean a power amplifier for driving loudspeakers. The term "amplify" basically means to make stronger. The strength of a signal (in terms of voltage) is referred to as amplitude. The two major types of amplification, and a third "derived" type:

. Voltage Amplifier - an amp that boosts the voltage of an input signal 
. Current Amplifier - an amp that boosts the current of a signal 
. Power Amplifier - the combination of the above two amplifiers


In the case of a voltage amplifier, a small input voltage will be increased, so that for example a 10mV (0.01V) input signal might be amplified so that the output is 1 Volt. This represents a "gain" of 100 - the output voltage is 100 times as great as the input voltage. This is called the voltage gain of the amplifier.

In the case of a current amplifier, an input current of 10mA (0.01A) might be amplified to give an output of 1A. Again, this is a gain of 100, and is the current gain of the amplifier. The power gain is therefore 10,000, which is the voltage gain multiplied by the current gain. In reality all amplifiers are power amplifiers, since a voltage cannot exist without power unless the impedance is infinite.

==== Input Impedance 
Amplifiers will be quoted as having specific input impedance. The load is that resistance or impedance placed on the output of an amplifier. In the case of a power amplifier, the load is most commonly a loudspeaker. Any load will require that the source (the preceding amplifier) is capable of providing it with sufficient voltage and current to be able to perform its task. In the case of a speaker, the power amplifier must be capable of providing a voltage and current sufficient to cause the speaker cone(s) to move. This movement is converted to sound by the speaker.

==== Output Impedance
The output impedance of an amplifier is a measure of the impedance or resistance "looking" back into the amplifier. It has nothing to do with the actual loading that may be placed at the output.

==== Feedback
Feedback in its broadest sense means that a certain amount of the output signal is "fed back" into the input. An amplifier - or an element of an amplifying device - is presented with the input signal, and compares it to a "small scale replica" of the output signal. If there is any difference, the amp corrects this, and ideally ensures that the output is an exact replica of the input, but with greater amplitude. Feedback may be as a voltage or current, and has a similar effect in either case.

In many designs, one part of the complete amplifier circuit (usually the input stage) acts as an error amplifier, and supplies exactly the right amount of signal to the rest of the amp to ensure that there is no difference between the input and output signals, other than amplitude.

==== Signal Inversion
When used as voltage amplifiers, all the standard active devices invert the signal. This means that if a positive signal goes in, it emerges as a larger - but now negative - signal.

==== Types of Amplifier Devices
A perfect amplifier or other device will perform its task within certain set limits, without adding or subtracting anything from the original signal. No ideal amplifying device exists, and as a result, no ideal amplifier exists, since all must be built with real-life (non-ideal) devices. 

The amplifying devices currently available are: 

. Vacuum Tube (Valve) 
. Bipolar Junction Transistor (BJT) 
. Field Effect Transistor (FET)

All of these devices are reliant on other non-amplifying ("support") components, commonly known as passive components. The passive devices are resistors, capacitors and inductors, and without these, we would be unable to build amplifiers at all. All the devices we use for amplification have a variable current output, and it is only the way that they are used that allows us to create a voltage amplifier. Valves and FETs are voltage controlled devices, meaning that the output current is determined by a voltage, and no current is drawn from the signal source. Bipolar transistors are current controlled, so the output current is determined by the input current.

==== Common Limiting Ratings 
All active devices have certain parameters in common. Essentially these are:

. Maximum Voltage - The maximum voltage that may be applied between the main terminals of the device. This varies from perhaps as low as 25V for small signal transistors and FETS, and up to 1,200V or more for some valves and high voltage transistors
. Maximum Current - The maximum current that the device may pass safely. Ranges from a few mA up to many amps. 
. Maximum Power Dissipation - The maximum power that the device may dissipate (in mW or W), under any condition of voltage and current. 
. Heater Voltage/Current - (Valves).  The operating voltage and / or current for the filament (directly heated cathodes) or heater (for indirectly heated cathodes). This should always be within 10% of the quoted value, or cathode life will be severely shortened. 
. Maximum Junction Temperature - (Semiconductors)  The maximum temperature that the semiconductor die will tolerate without failing. At this temperature, most semiconductors will be unable to perform any work, as this would raise the temperature above the maximum permissible. 
. Temperature Derating - (Semiconductors).  Above a specified temperature, the allowable power rating of semiconductor devices must be reduced to remain below the maximum allowable junction temperature. The power is normally derated above 25 degrees C. 
. Thermal Resistance - (Semiconductors).  The thermal resistance between junction and case (high power) or junction and air (low power). Measured in Degrees C/W, This allows a suitable heat-sink to be determined.

With most semiconductors, it is not possible to operate them at anywhere near the maximum power dissipation, because thermal resistance is such that the heat simply cannot be removed from the junction and into the heat-sink fast enough. In these cases, it might be necessary to use multiple devices to achieve the performance that can be obtained from a single component. This is very common in audio amplifiers.

=== Operational Amplifiers (Op-amps) 
The operational amplifier was originally used for analogue computers, although at that time they were made using discrete components. Modern (good) op-amps are so good, that it is difficult or impossible to achieve results even close with discrete transistors or FETs. However, there are still some instances where op-amps are just not suitable, such as when high supply voltages are needed for large voltage swings.

An operational amplifier or op-amp is an electronic circuit module (normally built as an integrated circuit, but occasionally with discrete transistors or vacuum tubes) which has a non-inverting input (+), an inverting input (-) and one output. The output voltage is the difference between the + and - inputs multiplied by the open-loop gain: 

image::images/Image-220716-111104.970.png[]

Since op-amps have uniform parameters and often standardized packaging as well as standard power supply needs, they help in designing an application fast.

Originally, op-amps were so named because they were used to model the basic mathematical operations (add, subtract, integrate, differentiate etc) in electronic analog computers. In this sense a true operational amplifier is an ideal circuit element. The real ones we use, made of transistors, tubes etc, are approximations to this ideal. The ideal op-amp has an infinite open-loop gain, infinite bandwidth, infinite input impedances, zero output impedance and zero noise, as well as zero input offset (0.0V out when both inputs are exactly equal) and no thermal drift. Modern integrated circuit MOSFET op-amps approximate closer and closer to these ideals in limited-bandwidth, large-signal applications at room temperature.

==== Notation
A typical circuit symbol for an op-amp looks like this:

image::images/Image-220716-111158.575.png[]

source: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Opamppinouts.png

Its terminals are:

. V~+~: non-inverting input 
. V~−~: inverting input 
. V~out~: output 
. V~S+~: positive power supply 
. V~S−~: negative power supply 

The power supply pins (V~S+~ and V~S-~) can be labeled many different ways. For FET based op-amps, the positive, common drain supply is labeled V~DD~ and the negative, common source supply is labeled V~SS~. For BJT based op-amps, the V~S+~ pin becomes V~CC~ and V~S−~ becomes V~EE~. They are also sometimes labeled V~CC+~ and V~CC−~, or even V~+~ and V~−~, in which case the inputs would be labeled differently.

If the positive input is most positive, then the output will swing to the positive supply rail (or as close as it can get). Should the negative input be more positive, and then the output will swing to the negative supply rail. The difference between the two inputs may be less than 1mV.

Modern op-amps is the nearest one to the ideal amplifier. The bandwidth is very wide indeed, with very low distortion, and low noise. Although it is quite possible to obtain an output impedance of far less than 10 Ohms, the current output is usually limited to about +/-20mA or so. Supply voltage of most op-amps is limited to a maximum of about +/-18V, although there are some that will take more, and others less. Depending on the opamp used, gains of 100 with a frequency response up to 100kHz are easily achieved, with noise levels being only very marginally worse that a dedicated discrete design using all the noise reducing tricks known. The circuits shown below have frequency response down to DC, with the upper frequency limit determined by device type and gain. 

**Figure 3.1 - Standard Opamp Configurations**

image::images/Image-220716-111808.852.png[]

Figure 3.1 shows the two most common opamp amplifier circuits. The first (4.1a) is non-inverting, and is the better connection for minimum noise. The voltage fed back through Rfb1 will cause a voltage to be developed across Rfb2. The output will correct itself until these two voltages are equal at any instant in time. It does not matter if the signal is a sine wave, square wave, or music, the opamp will keep.

Once the speed of the opamp is not significantly higher than the rate of change of the input (generally a factor of 10 is sufficient - i.e. the opamp needs to be 10 times faster than the highest frequency signal it is expected to amplify), the output will become distorted. At voltage gains of 10 or less, almost any opamp will be able to keep up with typical audio signals.

Input impedance is equal to Rin and voltage gain (Av) is calculated from:

**Av = (Rfb1 + Rfb2) / Rfb2**

The second circuit (4.1b) is an inverting amplifier, and is commonly used as a "summing" amplifier - the output is the negative sum of the three (or more) inputs. If the positive input is earthed (grounded), then the opamp must try to keep the -ve input at the same voltage - namely 0V.

Input impedance is equal to RinX (where X is the number of the input), and voltage gain is calculated from

**Av = Rfb / RinX**

Multiple inputs can all have different gains (and input impedances). If the source does not have output impedance significantly lower than Rin, then the gain will be lower than expected. If the circuit is configured for a gain of 1 (actually it is technically correct to refer to it as -1), Rin1, Rin2 etc. will all be equal to Rfb.

==== Power Op-amps 
Op-amps even come in power versions, using a TO-220 (or other specialized) case, and are typically capable of around 25W into an 8 Ohm speaker load. These devices, while not exactly to audiophile standards, are still very capable, and have been used by many domestic appliance manufacturers in such things as high-end TV sets and standard hi-fi equipment. Some of the more advanced devices are capable of output power up to 80W. 



== Low Power Dual Operational Amplifiers

=== General Description
The LM158 series consists of two independent, high gain, internally frequency compensated operational amplifiers which were designed specifically to operate from a single power supply over a wide range of voltages. Operation from split power supplies is also possible and the low power supply current drain is independent of the magnitude of the power supply voltage. 

Application areas include transducer amplifiers, dc gain blocks and all the conventional op amp circuits which now can be more easily implemented in single power supply systems. For example, the LM158 series can be directly operated off of the standard +5V power supply voltage which is used in digital systems and will easily provide the required interface electronics without requiring the additional ±15V power supplies. The LM358 and LM2904 are available in a chip sized package (8-Bump micro SMD) using National’s micro SMD package technology.

There is **no base band multiplexing** done on DTMF signals. The signal generated by a DTMF encoder is a direct algebraic summation, in real time, of the amplitudes of two sine (cosine) waves of different frequencies. When the 4 button is pressed, the 770 Hz and 1209 Hz tones are sent together. The telephone central office will then decode the number from this pair of tones. The tone frequencies were designed to avoid harmonics and other problems that could arise when two tones are sent and received<o:p></o:p>

They may sound rather musical when dialed (and representations of many popular tunes are possible), but they are not intended to be so. The tones should all be +/- 1.5% of nominal. The high frequency tone should be at least as loud, and preferably louder than the low frequency. It may be as much as 4 db louder. This factor is referred to as twist." If a Touchtone signal has +3db of twist, then the high frequency is 3 db louder than the low frequency. Negative twist is when the low frequency is louder.

=== STRUCTURAL DESCRIPTION
The 8870D/8870D-1 is a complete DTMF receiver integrating both the band split filter and digital decoder functions. The filter section uses switched capacitor techniques for high and low group filters; the decoder uses digital counting techniques to detect and decode all 16 DTMF tone pairs into a 14 bit code. External component count is minimized by on chip provision of a differential input amplifier, clock oscillator and latched three state bus interfaces.

=== FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
The MT8870D/8870D-1 monolithic receiver offer small size, low power consumption and high performance. Its architecture consists of a band split filter section, which separates the high low group tones, followed by a digital counting section which verifies the frequency and duration of the received tones before passing the corresponding code to the output bus.

===FILTER SECTION
Separation of the low and high group tones is achieved by applying the DTMF signal to the inputs of the sixth order switched capacitor band pass filter, the bandwidths of which correspond to the low and high frequencies. The filter section also incorporates notches at 350 and 440 Hz for exceptional dial tone rejection. Each filter output is followed by a single order switched capacitor filter, which smoothens the signals prior to limiting. The outputs of comparators provide full rail logic swings at different frequencies of the incoming DTMF signals.

=== DECODER SECTION
Following the filter section is a decoder employing digital counting techniques to determine the frequencies of the incoming tones and to verify that they correspond to standard DTMF frequencies. A complex averaging algorithm protects against tone stimulation by extraneous signals such as voice while providing tolerance to small frequency deviations and variations. This averaging algorithm has been developed to ensure an optimum combination of immunity to talk off and tolerance to the presence of interfering frequencies and noise. When the detector recognizes the presence of two valid tones the early steering output will go to an active state. Any subsequent loss of signal condition will cause Est to assume an inactive state.

==== STEERING CIRCUIT
Before registration of a decoded pair, the receiver checks for valid signal duration. This check is performed by an external RC time constant driven by E~st~. A logic high figure on E~st~ causes V~c~ to rise as the capacitor discharges. Provided signal condition is maintained for the validation period V~c~ reaches the threshold of the steering logic to register the tone pair, latching its corresponding 4-bit code into the output latch. At this point the GT output is activated and drives V~c~ to V~dd~. GT continues to drive as long as E~st~ remains high. 

Finally, after a short delay to allow the output latch to settle the delayed steering output flag Std goes high, signaling that a received tone pair has been registered. The contents of the output latch are made available on the 4-bit output bus by raising the three state control input to logic high. The steering circuit works in reverse to validate the inter digit pause between the signals. Thus as well as rejecting signals too short to be considered valid, the receiver will tolerate signal interruptions too short to be considered as a valid pause. This facility together with the capability of selecting the steering time constants externally allows the designer to meet a wide variety of system requirements.

==== GUARD TIME ADJUSTMENT
Components are chosen according to the formula

**Trec = Tdp + Tgtp**

**Tid = Tda + Tgta**

The value of Tdp is a device parameter and Trec is the minimum signal duration to be recognized by the receiver. A value for C=0.1 is recommended for most applications, leaving R to be selected by the designer.
POWER DOWN AND INHIBIT MODE
	Logic high applied to ‘pin 6’ will power down the device to minimize the power consumption in a standby mode. It stops the oscillator and the functions of the filter. Inhibit mode is enabled by a logic high input to the pin 5(INH). It inhibits the detection of tones representing characters A, B, C, D. The output will remain the same as the previous detected code.
DIFFERENTIAL INPUT CONFIGURATION
	The input arrangement provides a differential input operational amplifier as well as bias source (Vref) which is used to bias the inputs at mid-rail. Provision is made for connection of feedback resistor to op-amp output for adjustment of gain. In single ended configuration, the input pins are connected with the op-amps for unity gain.
CRYSTAL OSCILLATOR
	The internal clock circuit is with 3.579545 MHz crystal. It provides a time base for the circuit. The DTMF tones must be valid for a particular duration to be received by the DTMF receiver and decode it and convert it to its equivalent BCD output.

We have known that a computer system consists of three main components, the Central Processing Unit (CPU), the Memory and the Input/Output interface. Also we have the clock and the reset circuit. The miniaturization of the CPU onto a single chip is known as microprocessor. Further miniaturization leads to the integration of the RAM, the ROM and the I/O interface with the CPU, on a single silicon chip. These microcomputers on a single chip are known as MICROCONTROLLERS. 

The evolution of microprocessor technology launched of into developing more powerful microprocessors of increasing word lengths and into the integration of memory and I/O interface with the CPU, on a single chip and providing more and more I/O facilities on it.

This developed because of the need of fast real time control requiring the integration of the CPU, the memory and the I/O facilities on a single chip. More and more I/O facilities are being provided in microcontrollers such as D/A and A/D. The compactness of these microcontrollers has made it possible to provide automation to small and low cost systems and even toys. More powerful microcontrollers are available for sophisticated control applications.

Port 0 is an 8-bit open drain bi-directional I/O port. As an output port, each pin can sink eight TTL inputs. When 1s are written to port 0 pins, the pins can be used as high impedance inputs. Port 0 can also be configured to be the multiplexed low order address/data bus during accesses to external program and data memory. In this mode, P0 has internal pull-ups. Port 0 also receives the code bytes during Flash programming and outputs the code bytes during program verification. External pull-ups are required.

==== Port 1
Port 1 is an 8-bit bi-directional I/O port with internal pull-ups. The Port 1 output buffers can sink/source four TTL inputs. When 1s are written to Port 1 pins, they are pulled high by the internal pull-ups and can be used as inputs. As inputs, Port 1 pins that are externally being pulled low will source current (IIL) because of the internal pull-ups. Some Port 1 pins provide additional functions. P1.0 andP1.1 can be configured to be the timer/counter 2 external count input (P1.0/T2) and the timer/counter 2 trigger input (P1.1/T2EX), respectively.

Furthermore, P1.4, P1.5, P1.6, and P1.7 can be configured as the SPI slave port select, data input/output and shift clock input/output pins as shown in the following table.
